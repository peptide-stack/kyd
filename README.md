# Know Your Doses

A quick app to track your upcoming doses and historical.

Everything runs locally on your computer. You just need python. I am still working out the installation procedures, but you should be able to run it with:

`python3 ./KYD.py`

If you try this and have problems, feel free to ping me at `peptide stack at proton dot me` or find me on nostr at `npub1muk6qk9zre6e6xqpy7lejtx3879c46v3t3uh63d5u0umxy32fveswzs2yp`
